# Tensorflow-project

Data is from audiobook app. The purpose of this project is to create a machine learning algo, based on the data that can predict if a customer will buy again from the audiobook company. The main idea is that the company shouldn't spend its advertising budget targeting
individuals who are unlikely to come back. If we can focus our efforts on customers likely to convert
again, we can obtain improved sales and profitability figures.
